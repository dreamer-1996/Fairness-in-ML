# Fairness-in-ML

The following python notebook deals with analysis of the COMPAS algorithm.
This algorithm is used to assign certain risk factors (low, medium, high) to the criminals based on the questionnaire answered by the defendants.
The COMPAS is feed with these data and it output the “score-text”.
We are trying to observe if there is any bias in the classifier and if there is,how to remove the bias (Can we remove it at all?)
